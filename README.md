# confucian-anagrams

## what?

This document is the introduction to the software repository part
of an artistic project. Like most artistic projects, a clear
statement of **wtf** is going on is probably only possible for a
limited time, and not really of much value to the artist.

So i am skipping meta artistic issues for now. but they do indeed
exist.

At the end, i am looking to have 2 outcomes:
1. a pdf from LaTeX
2. a sqlite3 db and a shell script to be run by a cron process

And since programming is integral to the work- the end result[s]
of running the scripts are only viewed as one instance of the
work. This is not only in the sense of a quantum multiverse; but also like a
musical performance from a score.

I might also generate a better understanding of myself,
more skill with programming as an artistic tool, and a deeper
familiarity with the analects themselves.


## how?

I start with a (source text)[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3330] 
generously provided to the public by project gutenberg
* *title*: The Analects of Confucius (from the Chinese Classics) 
* *author*: Confucius, 551 BCE-479 BCE
* *translator*: Legge, James, 1815-1897

There are several steps that need to be applied to the source text
in a particular sequence in order to arrive at the desired
outcomes. These steps are all written in python (so far) with yaml
being the format used in data files.


## why?

don't (tempt|depress|lose) me ...

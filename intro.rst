Confucian Anagrams
==================
This is a project to take the Analects of Confucious and turn them
into something else. It may end up as poetry or it may end up as
nonsense- that is up to you more than I.

It is a project investigating how an ancient text can be modified
to fit better within our modern technological world. Having an
anti-authoritarian nature myself, there are many aspects of the
Confucian world view that are not the same as mine. Nonetheless, I
do not wish to ridicule the Analects, instead I hope to find a way
to pass them through some automated filters to come up with
something respectful interesting and wholly unexpected.

It's very easy to have high expectations at the start of a
project.

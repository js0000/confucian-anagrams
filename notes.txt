substitue characher names in analects for other more relevant
names, maybe chosen from a list so the same character may have a
different name each time. there can be a list of 'enlightened
beings' and one of 'philosophers' and so on ...

lines longer that 140 characters: try to split evenly as possible
on word if not sentence boundaries, maybe first computing what a
more or less equal N part split would look like, then adjusting
to word boundaries.

scheduling the pauses between tweets, there is a hierarchy.

1. between parts of a single verse, broken up to align with 140
char limit [actually less than 140 as there should be a citation
with each tweet]
2. between verses
3. between chapters
4. between books

initial estimates for these times
1. 128 mins [2 hour]
2. 256 mins [4 hour]
3. 512 mins [8 hour]
4. 1024 mins [16 hour]

another set- setting off chapters
1. 64 minutes
2. 128 minutes
3. 1024 minutes
